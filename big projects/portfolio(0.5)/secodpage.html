					"Milketh!" is a frogger-like platformer, where your main goal is to get the milk. The game was originally made for my cat, who surprisingly had the same name as the main character of "Milketh" - Bonia. Too bad she didin't know how to use a keyboard... This game eventually became a 'joke project', but it's still fun to play!
